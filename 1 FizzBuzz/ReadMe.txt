  We are going to write a function called fizzbuzz that will accept no arguments.
The goal of this function is to print out all numbers from "1" to "N" but with three exceptions: 
  
  For every number that is divisible by 3 and 5, console log "FizzBuzz". 
  
  For every number that is divisible by only 3 and not 5, console log "Fizz". 
  
  For every number that is divisible by only 5 and not 3, console .log "Buzz".

  Here is a partial example with numbers from 12 to 20:

      ...
      "Fizz"
      13
      14
      "FizzBuzz"
      16
      17
      "Fizz"
      19
      "Buzz"
      ...
